About Lean","context":"Theorem Proving in Lean 4\u0009Introduction","contents":"The Lean project was launched by Leonardo de Moura at Microsoft Research Redmond in 2013. It is an ongoing, long-term\neffort, and much of the potential for automation will be realized only gradually over time. Lean is released under the\nApache 2.0 license, a permissive open source license that permits others to use and extend the code and\nmathematical libraries freely.\n\nTo install Lean in your computer consider using the Quickstart instructions. The Lean source code, and instructions for building Lean, are available at\nhttps://github.com/leanprover/lean4/.\n\nThis tutorial describes the current version of Lean, known as Lean 4.\n\n"}});
