Prove these equivalences:You should also try to understand why the reverse implication is not derivable in the last example.2. It is often possible to bring a component of a formula outside a\n   universal quantifier, when it does not depend on the quantified\n   variable. Try proving these (one direction of the second of these\n   requires classical logic):3. Consider the “barber paradox,” that is, the claim that in a certain\n   town there is a (male) barber that shaves all and only the men who\n   do not shave themselves. Prove that this is a contradiction:4. Remember that, without any parameters, an expression of type\n   Prop\n is just an assertion. Fill in the definitions of prime\n   and Fermat_prime below, and construct each of the given\n   assertions. For example, you can say that there are infinitely many\n   primes by asserting that for every natural number n\n, there is a\n   prime number greater than n\n. Goldbach's weak conjecture states\n   that every odd number greater than 5 is the sum of three\n   primes. Look up the definition of a Fermat prime or any of the\n   other statements, if necessary.5. Prove as many of the identities listed in the Existential\n   Quantifier section as you can.\n\n\n","context":"Theorem Proving in Lean 4\u0009Quantifiers and Equality","header":"4.6.
