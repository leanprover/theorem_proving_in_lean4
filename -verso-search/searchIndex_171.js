For example, the local variable a occurs\nat let rec loop.\n\nYou can also use let rec in tactic mode and for creating proofs by induction.\n\n\n\nYou can also introduce auxiliary recursive declarations using where clause after your definition.\nLean converts them into a let rec.\n\n\n\n","context":"Theorem Proving in Lean 4\u0009Induction and Recursion","header":"8.4.
