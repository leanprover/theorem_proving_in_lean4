Importing Files","context":"Theorem Proving in Lean 4\u0009Interacting with Lean","contents":"The goal of Lean's front end is to interpret user input, construct\nformal expressions, and check that they are well-formed and type-correct.\nLean also supports the use of various editors, which provide\ncontinuous checking and feedback. More information can be found on the\nLean documentation pages.\n\nThe definitions and theorems in Lean's standard library are spread\nacross multiple files. Users may also wish to make use of additional\nlibraries, or develop their own projects across multiple files. When\nLean starts, it automatically imports the contents of the library\nInit folder, which includes a number of fundamental definitions\nand constructions. As a result, most of the examples we present here\nwork “out of the box.”\n\nIf you want to use additional files, however, they need to be imported\nmanually, via an import statement at the beginning of a file. The\ncommand\n\nimport Bar.Baz.Blah\n\nimports the file Bar/Baz/Blah.olean, where the descriptions are\ninterpreted relative to the Lean search path. Information as to how\nthe search path is determined can be found on the\ndocumentation pages.\nBy default, it includes the standard library directory, and (in some contexts)\nthe root of the user's local project.\n\nImporting is transitive. In other words, if you import Foo and Foo imports Bar,\nthen you also have access to the contents of Bar, and do not need to import it explicitly.\n\n"}});
