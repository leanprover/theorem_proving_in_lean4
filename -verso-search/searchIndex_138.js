Ordinary classical logic adds to\nthis the law of the excluded middle, p ∨ ¬p\n. To use this\nprinciple, you have to open the classical namespace.\n\n\n\nIntuitively, the constructive “Or” is very strong: asserting p ∨ q\n\namounts to knowing which is the case. If RH\n represents the Riemann\nhypothesis, a classical mathematician is willing to assert\nRH ∨ ¬RH\n, even though we cannot yet assert either disjunct.\n\nOne consequence of the law of the excluded middle is the principle of\ndouble-negation elimination:\n\n\n\nDouble-negation elimination allows one to prove any proposition,\np\n, by assuming ¬p\n and deriving False\n, because that amounts\nto proving ¬¬p\n. In other words, double-negation elimination allows\none to carry out a proof by contradiction, something which is not\ngenerally possible in constructive logic. As an exercise, you might\ntry proving the converse, that is, showing that em\n can be proved\nfrom dne\n.The classical axioms also give you access to additional patterns of\nproof that can be justified by appeal to em\n.  For example, one can\ncarry out a proof by cases:\n\n\n\nOr you can carry out a proof by contradiction:\n\n\n\nIf you are not used to thinking constructively, it may take some time\nfor you to get a sense of where classical reasoning is used.  It is\nneeded in the following example because, from a constructive\nstandpoint, knowing that p\n and q\n are not both true does not\nnecessarily tell you which one is false:\n\n\n\nWe will see later that there are situations in constructive logic\nwhere principles like excluded middle and double-negation elimination\nare permissible, and Lean supports the use of classical reasoning in\nsuch contexts without relying on excluded middle.\n\nThe full list of axioms that are used in Lean to support classical\nreasoning are discussed in Axioms and Computation.\n\n","context":"Theorem Proving in Lean 4\u0009Propositions and Proofs","header":"3.5.
