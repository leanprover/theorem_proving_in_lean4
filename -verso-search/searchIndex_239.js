Interacting with Lean","context":"Theorem Proving in Lean 4","contents":"You are now familiar with the fundamentals of dependent type theory,\nboth as a language for defining mathematical objects and a language\nfor constructing proofs. The one thing you are missing is a mechanism\nfor defining new data types. We will fill this gap in the next\nchapter, which introduces the notion of an inductive data type. But\nfirst, in this chapter, we take a break from the mechanics of type\ntheory to explore some pragmatic aspects of interacting with Lean.\n\nNot all of the information found here will be useful to you right\naway. We recommend skimming this section to get a sense of Lean's\nfeatures, and then returning to it as necessary.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}});
