The syntax for doing so is as follows:\n\nset_option <name> <value>\n\nOne very useful family of options controls the way Lean's pretty printer displays terms. The following options take an input of true or false:\n\npp.explicit  : display implicit arguments\npp.universes : display hidden universe parameters\npp.notation  : display output using defined notations\n\n\nAs an example, the following settings yield much longer output:\n\n\n\nThe command set_option pp.all true carries out these settings all\nat once, whereas set_option pp.all false reverts to the previous\nvalues. Pretty printing additional information is often very useful\nwhen you are debugging a proof, or trying to understand a cryptic\nerror message. Too much information can be overwhelming, though, and\nLean's defaults are generally sufficient for ordinary interactions.\n\n\n\n","context":"Theorem Proving in Lean 4\u0009Interacting with Lean","header":"6.10.
