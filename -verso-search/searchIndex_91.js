Much of the background information you will\nneed in order to do this is not specific to Lean at all. To start with, you will learn the logical system that Lean is\nbased on, a version of dependent type theory that is powerful enough to prove almost any conventional mathematical\ntheorem, and expressive enough to do it in a natural way. More specifically, Lean is based on a version of a system\nknown as the Calculus of Constructions with inductive types. Lean can not only define mathematical objects and express\nmathematical assertions in dependent type theory, but it also can be used as a language for writing proofs.\n\nBecause fully detailed axiomatic proofs are so complicated, the challenge of theorem proving is to have the computer\nfill in as many of the details as possible. You will learn various methods to support this in dependent type\ntheory. For example, term rewriting, and Lean's automated methods for simplifying terms and\nexpressions automatically. Similarly, methods of elaboration and type inference, which can be used to support\nflexible forms of algebraic reasoning.\n\nFinally, you will learn about features that are specific to Lean, including the language you use to communicate\nwith the system, and the mechanisms Lean offers for managing complex theories and data.\n\nThroughout the text you will find examples of Lean code like the one below:\n\n\n\nNext to every code example in this book, you will see a button that reads “Copy to clipboard”.\nPressing the button copies the example with enough surrounding context to make the code compile correctly.\nYou can paste the example code into VS Code and modify the examples, and Lean will check the results and provide feedback continuously as you type.\nWe recommend running the examples and experimenting with the code on your own as you work through the chapters that follow.\nYou can open this book in VS Code by using the command “Lean 4: Docs: Show Documentation Resources” and selecting “Theorem Proving in Lean 4” in the tab that opens.\n\n","context":"Theorem Proving in Lean 4\u0009Introduction","header":"1.3.
