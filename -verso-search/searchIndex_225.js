You saw in Variables and Sections that the\nsection command makes it possible not only to group together\nelements of a theory that go together, but also to declare variables\nthat are inserted as arguments to theorems and definitions, as\nnecessary. Remember that the point of the variable command is to\ndeclare variables for use in theorems, as in the following example:\n\n\n\nThe definition of double does not have to declare x as an\nargument; Lean detects the dependence and inserts it\nautomatically. Similarly, Lean detects the occurrence of x in\nt1 and t2, and inserts it automatically there, too.\nNote that double does not have y as argument. Variables are only\nincluded in declarations where they are actually used.\n\n","context":"Theorem Proving in Lean 4\u0009Interacting with Lean","header":"6.3.
