Displaying Information","context":"Theorem Proving in Lean 4\u0009Interacting with Lean","contents":"There are a number of ways in which you can query Lean for information\nabout its current state and the objects and theorems that are\navailable in the current context. You have already seen two of the\nmost common ones, #check and #eval. Remember that #check\nis often used in conjunction with the @ operator, which makes all\nof the arguments to a theorem or definition explicit. In addition, you\ncan use the #print command to get information about any\nidentifier. If the identifier denotes a definition or theorem, Lean\nprints the type of the symbol, and its definition. If it is a constant\nor an axiom, Lean indicates that fact, and shows the type.\n\n\n\n"}});
