Dependent Type Theory","context":"Theorem Proving in Lean 4","contents":"Dependent type theory is a powerful and expressive language, allowing\nyou to express complex mathematical assertions, write complex hardware\nand software specifications, and reason about both of these in a\nnatural and uniform way. Lean is based on a version of dependent type\ntheory known as the Calculus of Constructions, with a countable\nhierarchy of non-cumulative universes and inductive types. By the end\nof this chapter, you will understand much of what this means.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}});
