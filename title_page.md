This version of the text assumes youâ€™re using Lean 4. See the [Setting
Up Lean section](https://leanprover.github.io/lean4/doc/setup.html) of
the [Lean 4 Manual](https://leanprover.github.io/lean4/doc/) to install Lean. The first version of this book was
written for Lean 2, and the Lean 3 version is available
[here](https://leanprover.github.io/theorem_proving_in_lean/).
